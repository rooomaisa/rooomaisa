Hey there! 👋 I’m a front-end development student with a background as diverse as it is exciting. I began my career in physical therapy, where I mastered the art of problem-solving and collaboration. 
Those skills are still with me, but now I’m using them to tackle bugs and build stunning web experiences. 💻✨

After a transformative two-year adventure through Latin America 🌎, I returned with a fresh perspective and a passion for lifelong learning. 
This journey ignited my creativity and solidified my drive to dive into front-end development.

These days, you’ll find me knee-deep in code, turning ideas into digital reality. I’m still solving problems, just with a keyboard instead of a treatment plan. 
And when I’m not coding? I’m likely hitting the road on my motorcycle 🏍️, boxing 🥊, or trying out a new language—always up for the next challenge. 🌟

My goal is simple: make the web look good and work even better, all while keeping that spark of creativity alive. 
I’m excited to see where this front-end journey takes me and how I can make the digital world a little more awesome. 🚀
