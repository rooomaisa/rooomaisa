Hey there! 👋 I’m a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a background as diverse as it is creative. I started my career in physical therapy, where I learned the importance of problem-solving, precision, and working closely with people. Today, I bring those same skills into tech, solving challenges through code, logic, and design. 💻✨

After a transformative two-year journey through Latin America 🌎, I came back with a new perspective and a deep passion for lifelong learning and creativity. That adventure taught me adaptability, curiosity, and the value of building things that truly help people.

These days, you’ll find me turning ideas into clean, functional web applications using Java, React, and Spring Boot. I’m still solving problems, just with a keyboard instead of a treatment plan.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring on my motorcycle 🏍️, boxing 🥊, or picking up a new language, always chasing growth and the next challenge. 🌟

My goal is simple: to build meaningful, user-centered digital experiences that look great, perform smoothly, and make everyday life just a little easier. 🚀
